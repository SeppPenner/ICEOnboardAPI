This is the reverse engineered API for the ICE-Portal running in most of the ICE trains in Germany. This is only a Demo. Do not use it in production. This API is not offical!

## Usage
Use the unfinisehd iOS framework or run the demo app. Carthage may work as well. The API is only available on InTrain-WiFi.

## REST-API
If you are only interestst in the REST-API, look at [this document](https://github.com/lightsprint09/InTrain-ICE-API/blob/master/DemoPayload.md) to find URLs and example payloads.

##Contibution
If you want to improve this even further make a Pull Request. It would be nice to write tests as well.
